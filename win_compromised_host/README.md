# Windows - Compromised Host

## Pre-requisites

### Forensics Instance Setup

#### Windows

For the Forensics instance, we deploy a Windows instance and execute the [script](./InstallForensicsDeps.ps1) which will install all the necessary forensic tools discussed here. The script can also be modified to install most dependencies on a USB stick instead by editing the `INSTALL_LOCATION` variable.

Live memory images or disk images taken from the compromised instance can then be attached to the instance for analysis. Alternatively, USB sticks can be attached to the instance for live analysis.

#### Ubuntu
For the Forensics instance, we deploy an Ubuntu 22.04 instance and execute the [script](./install_forensics_deps.sh) which will install all the necessary forensic tools discussed here. Live memory images or disk images taken from the compromised instance can then be attached to this instance for analysis

## Containment

TBC

## Collection

### Live Collection

To collect live RAM, we can leverage the `Belkasoft RAM Capturer` available from download [here](https://belkasoft.com/ram-capturer) and initiate the appropriate x64 bin from a remote USB disk. The memory image is then stored on this remote disk too, say `F:`

Alternatively, we can also leverage `DumpIt.exe` provided by `Magnet Forensics` as part of its `Comae Toolkit` available [here](https://www.magnetforensics.com/resources/magnet-dumpit-for-windows/) to collect live RAM from the compromised host for analysis.
```
.\DumpIt.exe
```

## Analysis

### Live Analysis

In case of live analysis, we have ability to connect a USB stick to the contained instance with tools running on the USB stick. 

Note that majority of the steps described in `Offline / Disk Analysis` could be performed in `Live Analysis` as well by copying the binaries to the USB stick and attaching it to the compromised instance.

#### WMI Event Consumers Analysis

To detect malicious event consumers, we can use `WMIExplorer` GUI to examine the current machine's WMI Event Consumers and filters that are feeding the consumers to execute an action.

Alternatively, SysInternals `AutoRuns` can be used to detect WMI consumers, filters from the WMI tab and also delete them.

### Offline / Memory Analysis

In this section, we process the live `.raw` memory image file collected via tools such as `DumpIt` or `Belkasoft RAM Capturer` through tools like `volatility3`

#### Process Tree

We are able to review the live `.raw` RAM collected via any of the live collection methods using volatility3 with commands as follows via `volatility3` to list current processes:
```
cd /opt/volatility3
source venv/bin/activate
python3 vol.py -f /root/TEST-WIN-INSTAN-20240315-062005.raw windows.pslist.PsList windows.pslist.PsList
deactivate
```

We are also able to see the process from live `.raw` RAM as a tree like structure using `volatility3`:
```
cd /opt/volatility3
source venv/bin/activate
python3 vol.py -f /root/TEST-WIN-INSTAN-20240315-062005.raw windows.pslist.PsList windows.pstree.PsTree
deactivate
...

...
```

### Offline / Disk Analysis

In this section, we discuss a number of ways that information can be gathered from 

#### WMI Event Consumers Analysis

##### via wmi-parser / chainsaw

To detect [malicious event consumers](https://medium.com/threatpunter/detecting-removing-wmi-persistence-60ccbb7dff96), we can use `wmi-parser` to examine the current machine's WMI Event Consumers which could be both filtering and consuming WMI events (malicious indicators). The files are available in `C:\WINDOWS\system32\wbem\Repository\OBJECTS.DATA` OR `C:\WINDOWS\system32\wbem\Repository\FS\OBJECTS.DATA` folders.

```
.\wmi-parser.exe -i $PATH_TO_REPOSITORY\Repository\OBJECTS.DATA
```

If Sysmon is installed, then WMI Event Consumers will also appear in the sysmon logs in Event ID 19, 20, 21 as explained [here](https://medium.com/threatpunter/detecting-removing-wmi-persistence-60ccbb7dff96). These can be detected in Windows logs using `chainsaw`

```
.\chainsaw.exe search -t 'Event.System.EventID: =19' -t 'Event.System.Channel: Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational' C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs
# WmiEventConsumer - This will show the malicious code which executes when the WMI event is initiated
.\chainsaw.exe search -t 'Event.System.EventID: =20' -t 'Event.System.Channel: Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational' C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs
.\chainsaw.exe search -t 'Event.System.EventID: =21' -t 'Event.System.Channel: Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational' C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs
```

#### Google Chrome Notifications

##### via strings

If Google Chrome is in use and Notifications are enabled for website, then historical notifications are usually available in the `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Platform Notifications` as LevelDB Database. Extract the file and determine the clear-text notifications that a user may have received via `strings` or `xxd`. More info available [here](https://www.sans.org/blog/google-chrome-platform-notification-analysis/), [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/investigating-abusive-push-notification-browsers-chrome-jimmy-remy/) and the structure of the LevelDB database is described [here](https://sansorg.egnyte.com/dl/QaoN3qdhig)

```
strings MANIFEST/*
strings *.ldb
```

#### Check created and deleted files 

##### via Usn Journal ($J)

Extract the USN Journal which can contain useful information about created and deleted files as described [here](https://x.com/inversecos/status/1453588917337268233?s=20)
```
.\ExtractUsnJrnl64.exe /DevicePath:C: /OutputPath:C:\Windows\Temp
```

Parse the USN Journal for CSV output: 
```
.\UsnJrnl2Csv64.exe /UsnJrnlFile:C:\Windows\Temp\UsnJrnl_$J.bin
```

#### Build a wordlist for Extracting password encrypted files

##### via bulk_extractor

The command below will create a wordlist from disk data (can be offline images such as E01, .raw volatility images) which could be used for testing files that are encrypted
```
bulk_extractor -E wordlist -o /tmp/bulk_extractor $DISK_PATH
```
The above command creates a `wordlist_dedup_1.txt` which can be used for brute-forcing. More info is available [here](https://www.raedts.biz/forensics/building-wordlists-forensic-images/).

#### Detect time the system was turned on / off (timeline)

##### via TurnedOnTimesView

Capture the `System.evtx` file from `C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs` from the disk and store it in a new folder. Launch Nirsoft's `TurnedOnTimesView` utility > Options > Advanced Options > Select `Data Source` as `External Disk` > Point to the folder where `System.evtx` is added.

The times for start-up and shutdown are displayed for the system. Select all entries and copy/paste them to an .xlsx file for analysis.
