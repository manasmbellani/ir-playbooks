# Windows - Compromised Host

This playbook describes the steps to perform containment, analysis and recovery on a compromised Windows instance. Please note that it is assumed that the forensics and test instances are being deployed in a Google Cloud (GCP) environment, hence `gcloud` commands are provided for deploying, containing instances. 

The exact same concepts can be applied for other environments.

## Pre-requisites

### Forensics Instance Setup

#### Windows

For the Forensics instance, we deploy a Windows instance using the following command in `GCP` as an example:

```
# Deploy a windows forensics instance of type Windows Server 2022 DC edition, in project `citric-snow-362912` and disk size of 60GB
gcloud compute instances create windows-forensics-instance \
    --project=citric-snow-362912 \
    --zone=us-central1-c \
    --machine-type=e2-standard-4 \
    --network-interface=network-tier=PREMIUM,stack-type=IPV4_ONLY,subnet=default \
    --maintenance-policy=MIGRATE \
    --provisioning-model=STANDARD \
    --service-account=507227860050-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com \
    --scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.write,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/monitoring.write,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/servicecontrol,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/service.management.readonly,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/trace.append \
    --create-disk=auto-delete=yes,boot=yes,device-name=instance-20240421-220752,image=projects/windows-cloud/global/images/windows-server-2022-dc-v20240415,mode=rw,size=60,type=projects/citric-snow-362912/zones/us-central1-c/diskTypes/pd-balanced \
    --tags=rdp-server \
    --no-shielded-secure-boot \
    --shielded-vtpm \
    --shielded-integrity-monitoring \
    --labels=goog-ec-src=vm_add-gcloud \
    --reservation-affinity=any
```

Ensure that access to RDP port is enabled via the network tag `rdp-server` to be able to connect to the instance:
```
gcloud compute firewall-rules create rdp-server \
    --network "default" \
    --direction ingress \
    --allow=tcp:3389 \
    --target-tags=rdp-server \
    --description "Allow RDP port 3389 for accessing Windows servers"
```

Connect via RDP to the Forensics instance and launch Powershell as an Administrator. Then, execute the [script](./InstallForensicsDeps.ps1) which will install all the necessary forensic tools discussed here. The script can also be modified to install most dependencies on a USB stick instead by editing the `INSTALL_LOCATION` variable.

Live memory images or disk images taken from the compromised instance can then be attached to the instance for analysis. Alternatively, USB sticks can be attached to the instance for live analysis.

#### Ubuntu
For the Forensics instance, we deploy an Ubuntu 22.04 instance by following the steps [here](../gcp_compromised_pod#ubuntu). Live memory images or disk images taken from the compromised instance can then be attached to this instance for analysis

### Scenario Setup

To setup the scenario which can be explored, we deploy a Windows server and enable Sysmon with it using the sysmon config file available [here](https://gist.github.com/manasmbellani/1baccb274e6deae15befd0a736ad8f36/raw/sample-sysmon-config.xml)

```
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\opt\sysinternals\Sysmon64.exe -accepteula -i C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\opt\sysmon-config\sample-sysmon-config.xml
```

Additionally, we enable powershell logging via powerhshell:
```
Write-Host "[*] Enabling Module Logging..."
New-Item -Path "Registry::HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell" -Force
New-Item -Path "Registry::HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\ModuleLogging" -Force
New-Item -Path "Registry::HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\ModuleLogging\ModuleNames" -Force
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\ModuleLogging\ModuleNames" -Name "*" -Value "*" -PropertyType "String" -Force

Write-Host "[*] Enabling Scriptblock Logging..."
New-Item -Path "Registry::HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\ScriptBlockLogging" -Force
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\ScriptBlockLogging" -Name "EnableScriptBlockLogging" -Value "1" -PropertyType "DWORD" -Force
```

To clear windows audit event logs to start afresh, we run the following command:
```
wevtutil el | Foreach-Object {wevtutil cl "$_"}
```

Setup the Active Directory Certificate Services for practice as required by following the steps in the guide [here](https://campus.barracuda.com/product/websecuritygateway/doc/112167659/how-to-install-ad-cs-on-windows-server/) and setup the logging for Active Directory Certificate Services by following this guide [here](https://www.pkisolutions.com/enabling-active-directory-certificate-services-adcs-advanced-audit/). 

The server roles to install and configure in addition to `Certification Authority (CA)` are:
- Certification Authority
- Certificate Enrollment Policy Web Service
- Certificate Enrollment Web Service
- Certificate Authority Web Enrollment

Configure a new certificate by following the steps [here](https://thesecmaster.com/blog/step-by-step-procedure-to-create-a-custom-csr-on-a-windows-server) to generate a CSR and receive a certificate.

Change the Group Policy to enable logging to be enabled for ADCS services as described [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/dn786422(v=ws.11)):

```
certutil â€“setreg CA\AuditFilter 127
net stop certsvc && net start certsvc
```

This would then allow the CA settings to be logged via the GPO / Local Security Policy as described [here](https://www.pkisolutions.com/enabling-active-directory-certificate-services-adcs-advanced-audit/):

```
Write-Host "[*] Enabling Object Access (including ADCS if enabled) audit policy..."
$command='& auditpol /set /category:"Object Access" /subcategory:"Certification Services" /success:enable /failure:enable'
Invoke-Expression "$command"
```

Ensure that auditing is set for all events under `certsrv.msc` > `Certification Authority` > Right-Click > Auditing > `Events to Audit`

Auditing should also be enabled for certificate templates via `ADSI Edit > Action > Connect to... > Select 'Configuration' in Naming Context instead of Default > CN=Services > CN=Public Key Services > CN=Certificate Templates`

## Containment

### Disconnect from wired networks

Remove ethernet cables AND other accessories e.g. desktop extenders which may have ethernet cables connected  to them.

### Disable IP networks

#### via netsh

List all the network interfaces

```
netsh interface show interface
```

Disable the specific network interaces

```
netsh interface set interface $INTERFACE_NAME admin=disabled
```

#### via powershell / Get-NetAdapter

List the network adapters:
```
Get-NetAdapter
```

Disable the specific network adapters:
```
Disable-NetAdapter -Name "$ADAPTER_NAME" -Confirm:$false
```

### Forget wireless networks

#### via netsh

Forget wireless networks

```
# Windows 10
netsh wlan delete profile name=* i=*

# OS earlier than Windows 10
netsh wlan delete profile *
```

### Disable BlueTooth Networks

#### via UI

Find option in the task bar to disable bluetooth network.

### Disable User Account

#### via powershell / Active Directory

```
Disable-ADAccount -Identity $UserName
```

## Collection

### Collect Live RAM 

#### via Belkasoft

To collect live RAM, we can leverage the `Belkasoft RAM Capturer` available from download [here](https://belkasoft.com/ram-capturer) and initiate the appropriate x64 bin from a remote USB disk. The memory image is then stored on this remote disk too, say `F:`

#### via DumpIT

Alternatively, we can also leverage `DumpIt.exe` provided by `Magnet Forensics` as part of its `Comae Toolkit` available [here](https://www.magnetforensics.com/resources/magnet-dumpit-for-windows/) to collect live RAM from the compromised host for analysis.
```
.\DumpIt.exe
```

#### via FTK Imager

```
"C:\Program Files\AccessData\FTK Imager\FTK Imager.exe" > File > Capture Memory > Select Destination Path (e.g. C:\Windows\TEMP) > Include Pagefile.sys
```

#### via winpmem

```
# Run as administrator for x64 system
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\opt\winpmem\winpmem_mini_x64_rc2.exe C:\Windows\Temp\physmem.raw

# Run as administrator for x86 system
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\opt\winpmem\winpmem_mini_x86.exe C:\Windows\Temp\physmem.raw
```

#### via velocirpator

Access GUI via https://127.0.0.1:8889, and leverage `Windows.Memory.Acquisition` to collect memory. Uses `winpmem` in the background to collect live memory.

##### deploying velocirpator 

In GUI Mode:
```
cd C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\opt\velociraptor
velociraptor.exe gui
```

### Collect Disk Image

#### via FTK Imager

Can be used to create various disk types such as Raw Image (`dd`), Smart, E01 (Autopsy/Encase compatible) and AFF.
```
"C:\Program Files\AccessData\FTK Imager\FTK Imager.exe" > File > Create Disk Image > Physical Drive
```

For folders (e.g. `Kape` disk artifacts below ), can create `AD1` type disk image

#### via dc3dd

Identify the `PHYSICALDRIVE` image identifier to create disk of using FTK Imager [here](#via-ftk-imager-1)

Run `dc3dd` command to take an image to specified folder:

```
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\opt\dc3dd\dc3dd-dcfl-win7-64-7-2-641\dc3dd.exe if=\\.\PHYSICALDRIVE0 of=C:\Windows\Temp\disk.dd hash=sha256 log=C:\Windows\Temp\disk.log
```

Taken from [here](https://www.forensicfocus.com/articles/windows-drive-acquisition/)

### Collect Windows Event Logs

#### via powershell

Use [Get-WinEvtxLogs.ps1](Get-WinEvtxLogs.ps1) script to retrieve the logs on the device

### Collect Disk Artifacts

#### via Kroll (KAPE)

KAPE can also be run from a USB stick as described [here](https://threatintelligencelab.com/tools/step-by-step-guide-to-forensically-acquiring-logs-with-kape/#:~:text=Insert%20USB%20Drive%3A%20Plug%20the,selecting%20%E2%80%9C%20Run%20as%20Administrator%20%E2%80%9C.)

```
cd C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\opt\kape\KAPE
.\kape.exe --sync

# Perform most important file collection on a disk to a specific destination. Leverage .\gkape.exe to build the command (without 'Flush' ideally)
.\kape.exe --tsource C: --tdest C:\Windows\Temp --target !SANS_Triage --gui
```

See [FTK Imager](#via-ftk-imager) for more information on how to create disk images (AD1) .

#### via velociraptor

Follow the steps [here](##deploying-velocirpator) to launch velociraptor > start `Hunt` on targets via `Windows.KapeFiles.Targets` to collect Kapefiles > Select `_SANS_Triage`

#### via WINTri

```
cd C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\opt\WINTri
.\WINTri.ps1
```

Taken from [here](https://github.com/DCScoder/WINTri)

### Mount Disks

#### via FTK Imager

Can be used to mount both physical (e.g. E01) and logical disks

#### via linux / ewfmount

Can be used to mount disk in Linux host

```
ewfmount charlie-work-usb-2009-12-11.e01 /mnt/disk

mkdir /mnt/disk /mnt/windows_data

# Find sector where NTFS partition starts (this is *512 bytes)
mmls  /mnt/disk/ewf1
mount -t ntfs-3g -o loop,ro,show_sys_files,stream_interface=windows,offset=$((1*512)) /mnt/disk/ewf1 /mnt/windows_mount
```

To unmount:

```
umount /mnt/windows_mount
umount /mnt/disk
```

Taken from [here](https://dfirmadness.com/mounting-case001-e01-files/)

### Detect Encrypted Disks

#### via Magnet Forensics' Encrypted Disk Detector

Good to know if disks are encrypted beforehand during collection steps since encrypted disks may lose more volatile data than non-encrypted disks as described [here](https://www.raedts.biz/forensics/should-you-pull-the-plug/)

```
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\opt\encrypted-disk-detector\encrypted-disk-detector.exe
```

### Export Emails for Analysis

Assuming the compromise could have started using phishing emails.

#### for Office 365

Refer to this [link](../azure_compromised_account/README.md#extract-emails-for-analysis) for details on how to export emails for analysis e.g. in case of phishing sites.

## Analysis

This section covers a variety of techniques which can be used for both live and offline analysis.

In case of live analysis, we have ability to connect a USB stick to the contained instance with tools running on the USB stick. 

Note that majority of the steps described in `Offline / Disk Analysis` could be performed in `Live Analysis` as well by copying the binaries to the USB stick and attaching it to the compromised instance.

### Detection for unusual active directory services changes

- Can detect changes to Active Directory Group Services

#### via Windows Audit Event Logs / 5136

```
# Look for changes from unusual 'Subject.Account Name' 
EventID = 5136 (A directory service object was modified)
Channel = Security
```

### Look for interesting indicators in data 

#### via bulk_extractor

See [here](../linux_compromised_host/README.md#look-for-interesting-indicators-in-data)

### Detect for unusual powershell sessions

Look for interesting keywords in commands OR in powershell:

```
# interesting argument in commands normally observed
powershell.exe  -ExecutionPolicy Bypass

# Could be Intune based powershell execution / malware delivery: https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/lightshow-north-korea-unc2970/
powershell.exe -NoProfile -executionPolicy bypass -file "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Intune Management Extension\Policies\Scripts\$GUID.../"

# To invoke commands on one or more computers
# Powershell remoting e.g. Invoke-Command -ComputerName $computer -ScriptBlock { ...<powershell code> } -ArgumentList ...
Invoke-Command -ComputerName $computer ...
```

#### via powershell module logging / event ID 4103

Usually 4104 (ScriptBlock text) ok for most unusual detections, Can be used to detect bypass for ScriptBlock logging attempts as documented in [dfir.ch](https://dfir.ch/posts/scriptblock_smuggling/)

```
Event ID = 4103 (CommandInvocation)

- A successful session occurs when the two computers are on the same network and the user has a user name and password that are accepted by the server. 

#### via net

```
net view \\127.0.0.1
```

### Detect Windows SMB Shares Exposed on the network

#### via powershell / Get-SmbShare

```
Get-SmbShare

```

### Detection of unusual ADCS certificate requests / Active Directory Certificate Services Abuse - SAN Template Certificates (ESC1)

- Typically, Extended Key Usage (EKU) attributes are used to define how a Public-private key pair generate for a user  can be used.
- Compromise Type 1: If attacker steals Bobâ€™s private key and certificate, and the certificate has an authentication EKU, the attacker can authenticate to the AD domain without knowing Bobâ€™s password
- Compromise Type 2 (ESC1): If a template with an authentication EKU lets low-privilege users specify SANs, an attacker can authenticate as any user in the SAN (eg for a cert with user "Alice", attacker can specify a domain admin account e.g. ace@aceresponder.com)
- Pre-requisites for ESC1:
  - enrollment rights granted to low-privilege users
  - an authentication EKU (Client Authentication, PKINIT Client Authentication, Smart Card Logon, Any Purpose)
  - ability for the requestor to specify SANs

https://www.aceresponder.com/learn/adcs

#### via certsrv.msc

Launch `certsrv.msc` > Look at `issued certificates` > identify certificates that have a `Subject Alternative Name` - `Other Name` specified.

Taken from [here](https://www.aceresponder.com/learn/adcs)

#### via Windows Event Logs / Object Access (4887)

Pre-requiste: Requires the Windows Event Logging to be turned on.

```
# Look for unusual non-matching user name in `Requester` in the windows event log.
EventID = 4886 ("Certificate Services received a certificate request.")
Channel = Security
```


#### via Windows Event Logs / Object Access (4887)

Pre-requiste: Requires the Windows Event Logging to be turned on.

```
# Look for non-matching user name in `Requester` and subject alternative name (`Subject`), (`Attributes`) in the windows event log.
# SAN user name can also appear in subject alternative name
EventID = 4887 ("Object Access")
Channel = Security
Description: Certificate Services approved a certificate request and issued a certificate.
```

#### via Windows Event Logs / Object Access (4887) / ElasticSearch

```
event.code:4887 AND winlog.event_data.Attributes:*SAN\:*
```

Taken from [here](https://www.aceresponder.com/learn/adcs)

#### via RPC Firewall / Elastic search

Pre-requiste: Requires Zero Networks' [RPC Firewall](https://www.aceresponder.com/blog/disrupting-offensive-rpc) to be enabled.

```
winlog.provider_name:RPCFW AND event.code:3 AND winlog.event_data.arg_6.SubjectAltNames:*
```

See [here](https://www.aceresponder.com/blog/disrupting-offensive-rpc)

### Look for certificate based authentication from certificates for ADCS

- Could be useful to detect to detect certificate based authentication and compromise attempts for ESC1 and other ADCS vulnerabilities
  
#### via Windows Audit Event Logs / ID 4768

```
# Certificate Information.Certificate Serial Name, Certificate Information.Thumbprint has the details
# Account Information.Account Name has the details as well of the account for which the certificate was requested
EventID = 4768
Channel = Security
Description = A Kerberos Authentication Ticket was requested
Certificate Information.Certificate Issuer Name = *
```

### Detection of Active Directory Certificate Services Abuse - Any Purpose EKU (ESC2)

Any Purpose (OID 2.5.29.37.0), OR no EKU (SubCA)

#### via OID search

Search for `2.5.29.37.0` OR `SubCA` in all logs and focus on certificate services logs

### Detection of Active Directory Certificate Services Abuse - Certificate Request Agent (ESC3)

If an attacker gets a certificate with the Certificate Request Agent EKU (`1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.1`), they can enroll on behalf of another user. In other words, they can ask the CA to sign a certificate for a higher-privilege account.

#### via OID Search

Search for `1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.1` in all logs and focus on certificate services logs

### Detection of unusual authentication attempts / logon attempts

- Look for excessive failed authentication attempts eg password spray or brute-force
- Look for PSExec attempts (which is typically `LogonType=5`)
- Look for non-null source network address as these are likely malicious attempts (`LogonType=3`)
- Look for authentication attempts from hostnames (e.g. `DESKTOP-XXX`) OR IP addresses if your company which do not follow the naming convention for hostnames including in any VPN logs eg [here](`https://www.linkedin.com/posts/stephan-berger-59575a20a_another-fun-one-the-user-runs-an-installer-activity-7225755841981755392-CnlB/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios`).  For VPN, see GlobalProtect log field `Machine Name` in format [here](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/monitoring/use-syslog-for-monitoring/syslog-field-descriptions/globalprotect-log-fields)
- Look for overpass-the-hash attempts as described [here](https://detection.fyi/sigmahq/sigma/windows/builtin/security/account_management/win_security_overpass_the_hash/)
- To identify brute-force sweeps e.g. SMB sweep / password spray, Look for logon for a username across multiple hosts in a short period of time

#### via Windows Event Logs / 4624, 4625

```
# Look for logons across multiple hosts over a short period 

Channel = Security
EventID=4624 (An account was successfully logged on) OR 4625 (An account failed to log on)
LogonType = 2 (Interactive) OR 3 (Network) OR 5 (Service started by Service Control Manager) 8 (NetworkClearText)

OR

# Overpass-the-hash detection (https://detection.fyi/sigmahq/sigma/windows/builtin/security/account_management/win_security_overpass_the_hash/)
EventID = 4624
LogonType = 9 (NewCredentials)
LogonProcessName = seclogo
AuthenticationPackageName = Negotiate
```

Taken from [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-10/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4625#_Ref433822321)

#### via Windows Event Logs / 4771, 4776

- Very good for identification of password brute-force attempts via tools like kerbrute, crackmapexec

```
# 'Logon Account' field shows the username that was attempted
Channel = Security
EventID = 4776 (The computer attempted to validate the credentials for an account.)

# Account Information.Account Name contains the name of the account that was attempted
Channel = Security
EventID = 4771 (Kerberos Pre-Authentication failed.)
```

#### via Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Hunting / KQL

```

| sort by Timestamp desc 
```

### Detection of PSExec usage to authenticate

https://www.hackthebox.com/blog/how-to-detect-psexec-and-lateral-movements

Along with these detections, look for EventID=`4624` and logontype=`5` (Service startup) to identify which user may have performed this `PSExec.exe` authentication

Detections mostly taken from: https://www.hackthebox.com/blog/how-to-detect-psexec-and-lateral-movements

#### via Windows Sysmon Event Logs / 1

```
EventID = 7036 (The PSEXESVC service entered the running state.)
Channel = System
```

### Detection of Active Directory Certificate Services Abuse - Template Modification (ESC4)

- Since templates are securable AD objects, an attacker with control can abuse them like any other AD object.
    - Eg. an attacker can effectively make a template vulnerable to ESC1 and request a user with a SAN. ESC1 behavior is set by the CT_FLAG_ENROLLEE_SUPPLIES_SUBJECT flag in the templateâ€™s ms-PKI-Certificate-Name-Flag property.

#### via Windows Event Logs / 4900 (Changes to Certificate Security Descriptor / ACL)

```
Channel = Security
EventID = 4900 (Certificate Services template security was updated)
```

Example of this Event ID is [here](https://www.ultimatewindowssecurity.com/securitylog/encyclopedia/event.aspx?eventid=4900)

#### via Windows Event Logs / 4899 (Changes to Certificate Template)

```
Channel = Security
EventID = 4899 (A Certificate Services template was updated)

```
# Look at the Account Name for the person that made the change. ms-PKI-Certificate-Name-Flag = {ea1dddc4-60ff-416e-8cc0-17cee534bce7} which is used for introducing ESC1 vulnerability (SAN)
EventID = 4662 (An operation was performed on an object)
Channel = Security
Operation.Properties = "*Write-Property*"
# Records changes to 'PKI-Certificate-Template' OR 'ms-PKI-Certificate-Name-Flag'
Operation.Properties = "*{ea1dddc4-60ff-416e-8cc0-17cee534bce7}*" OR "*{e5209ca2-3bba-11d2-90cc-00c04fd91ab1}*"

### WMI Event Consumers Analysis

To detect malicious event consumers, we can use `WMIExplorer` GUI to examine the current machine's WMI Event Consumers and filters that are feeding the consumers to execute an action.

Alternatively, SysInternals `AutoRuns` can be used to detect WMI consumers, filters from the WMI tab and also delete them.

### Check various installed Application Logs

- Can provide indications of any exploits especially for running servers such as TightVNC, Mail servers, etc.
- Can also provide forensics artifacts eg SHA and file paths

#### via Program Files 

Common location for logs:

- Microsoft Windows Defender: See Windows Defender Logs [here](#via-windows-defender-logs). Can indicate SHA-1 hashes and the paths to the processes executed.

- ShareTool: `C:\PerfLogs\write-test.shareaudit`. Taken from [here](https://x.com/malmoeb/status/1825085850092220432)

- Minecraft: `C:\Users\LetsDefend\Desktop\Minecraft Server 1.12.2\logs`

### WMI Event Consumers Analysis

#### via wmi-parser / chainsaw

To detect [malicious event consumers](https://medium.com/threatpunter/detecting-removing-wmi-persistence-60ccbb7dff96), we can use `wmi-parser` to examine the current machine's WMI Event Consumers which could be both filtering and consuming WMI events (malicious indicators). The files are available in `C:\WINDOWS\system32\wbem\Repository\OBJECTS.DATA` OR `C:\WINDOWS\system32\wbem\Repository\FS\OBJECTS.DATA` folders.

```
.\wmi-parser.exe -i $PATH_TO_REPOSITORY\Repository\OBJECTS.DATA
```

If Sysmon is installed, then WMI Event Consumers will also appear in the sysmon logs in Event ID 19, 20, 21 as explained [here](https://medium.com/threatpunter/detecting-removing-wmi-persistence-60ccbb7dff96). These can be detected in Windows logs using `chainsaw`

```
.\chainsaw.exe search -t 'Event.System.EventID: =19' -t 'Event.System.Channel: Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational' C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs
# WmiEventConsumer - This will show the malicious code which executes when the WMI event is initiated
.\chainsaw.exe search -t 'Event.System.EventID: =20' -t 'Event.System.Channel: Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational' C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs
.\chainsaw.exe search -t 'Event.System.EventID: =21' -t 'Event.System.Channel: Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational' C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs
```

### Google Chrome Notifications

#### via strings

If Google Chrome is in use and Notifications are enabled for website, then historical notifications are usually available in the `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Platform Notifications` as LevelDB Database. Extract the file and determine the clear-text notifications that a user may have received via `strings` or `xxd`. More info available [here](https://www.sans.org/blog/google-chrome-platform-notification-analysis/), [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/investigating-abusive-push-notification-browsers-chrome-jimmy-remy/) and the structure of the LevelDB database is described [here](https://sansorg.egnyte.com/dl/QaoN3qdhig)

```
strings MANIFEST/*
strings *.ldb
```

### Get Boot sector information

#### via MFTECmd / $Boot
```
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\opt\EZTools\net6\MFTECmd.exe -f 'C:\Windows\Temp\C\$Boot' --csv C:\Windows\Temp --csvf Boot.csv
```

### Check created and deleted files 

#### via windows sysmon event ID 26 / windows sysmon event ID 23

```
EventID: 23
Channel: Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational
```

#### via Usn Journal ($J)

Extract the USN Journal which can contain useful information about created and deleted files as described [here](https://x.com/inversecos/status/1453588917337268233?s=20)
```
.\ExtractUsnJrnl64.exe /DevicePath:C: /OutputPath:C:\Windows\Temp
```

Parse the USN Journal for CSV output: 
```
.\UsnJrnl2Csv64.exe /UsnJrnlFile:C:\Windows\Temp\UsnJrnl_$J.bin
```

#### via Kape / MFTECmd / $J

Use Kape as described [here](#via-kroll-kape) to collect `$EXTEND\$J`
```
# Assumed that Kape used to obtain $Extend/$J (via SANS Triage)
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\opt\EZTools\net6\MFTECmd.exe -f "E:\C\$Extend\$J" --csv C:\Windows\Temp --csvf MFT-J.csv
```

#### via Kape / MFTEcmd / $Logfile

Use Kape as described [here](#via-kroll-kape) to collect `$LogFile`

As described [here](https://superuser.com/a/577272), the `$Logfile` is a special NTFS system file. It is a circular log of all disk operations and is used to roll back disk operations. 

```
# Assumed that Kape used to obtain $Extend/$J (via SANS Triage)
C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\opt\EZTools\net6\MFTECmd.exe -f "E:\C\$LogFile" --csv C:\Windows\Temp --csvf Logfile.csv
```

For timestomping, look for criteria: 
```
Operation: CreateAttribute
Filename: file.txt (or your filename)
CurrentAttribute: $FILE_NAME 
```

### Windows Registry Paths

Following registries present in `C:\Windows\System32\config`:
- SAM
- SYSTEM
- SECURITY
- SOFTWARE
- DEFAULT
- COMPONENTS

Following registries are present in `C:\Users\$USERNAME`:
- NTUSER.DAT

Following registries are present in `C:\Users\$USERNAME\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows`:
- UsrClass.dat

### Export Registry to file

#### via RegRipper

Saves registry as .txt file

### Extract Deleted Registry Keys

#### via RegExplorer

Ensure that Options > Recover Deleted keys/values is selected

The deleted keys/values then appaar in the left-hand navigation pane as unassociated records

### Get Device timezone

#### via Registry / System

See `System/CurrentControlSet/Control/TimeZoneInformation`

### Build a wordlist for Extracting password encrypted files

#### via bulk_extractor

The command below will create a wordlist from disk data (can be offline images such as E01, .raw volatility images) which could be used for testing files that are encrypted
```
bulk_extractor -E wordlist -o /tmp/bulk_extractor $DISK_PATH
```
The above command creates a `wordlist_dedup_1.txt` which can be used for brute-forcing. More info is available [here](https://www.raedts.biz/forensics/building-wordlists-forensic-images/).

### Detect time the system was turned on / off (timeline)

#### via TurnedOnTimesView

Capture the `System.evtx` file from `C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs` from the disk and store it in a new folder. Launch Nirsoft's `TurnedOnTimesView` utility > Options > Advanced Options > Select `Data Source` as `External Disk` > Point to the folder where `System.evtx` is added.

The times for start-up and shutdown are displayed for the system. Select all entries and copy/paste them to an .xlsx file for analysis. 

More info is [here](https://www.raedts.biz/forensics/find-system-powered/)

### Searching Windows Logs

#### via powershell / Get-WinEvent

```
Get-ChildItem -Path . | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Name | %{ Get-WinEvent -Path $_ } | Where-Object { $ _.ID -eq "4799" }

# Detect Process Access Sysmon (Event ID 10) Logs where Lsass is accessed
$events = Get-WinEvent -Path .\LsassDump.evtx |Where-Object {$_.ID -eq 10}
$events |Where-Object {$_.Properties[8].Value -Like '*Lsass*'} |Format-List
```
